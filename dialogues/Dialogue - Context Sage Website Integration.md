# Dialogue: Context Sage Website Integration

## Protocol
**Pattern:** Skill Forge (Heterogeneous AI Deliberation)
**Roles:**
- **HO (Human Orchestrator):** Ed O'Connell
- **GA (Generalizing AI):** Claude Code (Opus 4.5)
- **IA (Inspecting AI):** ChatGPT

**Gates:**
- **Understanding Gate (UG):** IA confirms understanding of proposal
- **Agreement Gate (AG):** Both agents agree on implementation approach

**Evidence Protocol:**
- GA provides GitHub Actions run URLs (not just YAML paths)
- GA commits screenshots to `/evidence/` for IA verification
- IA cannot render SPAs; screenshots are primary evidence

**Binding Invariants (from v1.1.0):**
- Single artifact per deliberation cycle
- AMORTIZATION.md section required for AG closure
- Proxy Execution Clause: tools execute, IA judges
- Step 9: Skill Review at Handshake

---

## Context

This deliberation continues the artifact integration sequence established in "Dialogue - Portfolio Artifact Integration.md". That deliberation produced:
- v1.1.0 with SkillForgeVisualizer integration
- Reusable boundary marker components
- HashRouter routing infrastructure
- Multi-route accessibility testing
- AMORTIZATION.md economic accounting framework

**Current state:**
- Repo: `github.com/adambalm/portfolio`
- Version: v1.1.0
- Live: https://adambalm.github.io/portfolio/
- CI: All passing (17 accessibility tests)

**Objective:** Integrate ContextSageWebsite artifact as the second artifact in the portfolio.

## Turn 1: GA Proposal

**From:** Claude Code (GA)
**To:** ChatGPT (IA)
**Date:** 2026-01-06

### Proposal: ContextSageWebsite Integration

I propose integrating ContextSageWebsite from the vite-playground repository as the second artifact in the portfolio. This follows the single-artifact-per-cycle discipline established in v1.1.0.

### Artifact Summary

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Name | ContextSageWebsite |
| LOC | 695 |
| External Dependencies | None (pure React) |
| Source | `vite-playground/src/ContextSageWebsite.jsx` |
| Description | Tufte-inspired content site explaining the Knowledge System |

### Artifact Characteristics

**Visual Direction:** Tufte-inspired readability
- Light background (#fffff8), dark text (#111)
- Serif typography (Palatino, Georgia)
- Wide margins, generous whitespace
- No gradients, no decoration
- Italic headers, not bold

**Sections:** Landing, Architecture, Evidence, The Argument, Provenance, About

**Content Source:** Built by reading structured notes from Basic Memory knowledge base. The construction chain is documented in the artifact itself.

### Technical Approach

#### 1. Copy artifact
```
vite-playground/src/ContextSageWebsite.jsx → portfolio/src/artifacts/ContextSageWebsite.jsx
```

#### 2. Create page wrapper with boundary markers
```jsx
// src/pages/ContextSagePage.jsx
<section aria-labelledby="context-sage-section">
  <h2 id="context-sage-section">Context Sage Website</h2>

  <ProvenanceHeader
    agent="Claude (Opus 4.5)"
    date="2026-01-02"
    context="Knowledge System documentation website"
    sourceUrl="https://github.com/adambalm/portfolio/blob/main/src/artifacts/ContextSageWebsite.jsx"
  />

  <EpistemicBadge status="ILLUSTRATIVE" />

  <AuthorshipMarker
    type="AI"
    details="Generated by Claude from Basic Memory knowledge base"
  />

  <DemoContainer title="Context Sage Documentation">
    <ContextSageWebsite />
  </DemoContainer>
</section>
```

#### 3. Add route
```jsx
<Route path="context-sage" element={<ContextSagePage />} />
```

#### 4. Update Landing page
Add ContextSageWebsite to the artifacts array, move from deferred to active.

#### 5. Update accessibility tests
Add route to test array:
```javascript
{ path: '/#/context-sage', name: 'Context Sage' }
```

### Accessibility Considerations

**Potential concerns:**
1. **Serif font stack:** Palatino, Georgia are standard system fonts with good legibility
2. **Color contrast:** Need to verify Tufte palette meets WCAG 2.1 AA (4.5:1)
3. **Internal navigation:** Tab-based section switching needs keyboard accessibility audit
4. **Code blocks:** Monospace text in diagrams needs contrast verification

**Mitigation:** Will run full axe-core scan and fix any violations before AG closure.

### Style Isolation

The DemoContainer component provides style isolation. The Tufte styling (serif fonts, cream background) will be contained within the demo boundary and won't affect the portfolio shell.

### Amortization Claims (Draft)

Building on v1.1.0 infrastructure, I expect:
- **Route addition:** ~5 minutes (vs ~2 hours in v1.0.0)
- **Boundary marker integration:** 4 imports, no custom code
- **Test extension:** 1 line addition to routes array
- **No new dependencies required**

Final amortization note will document actual vs expected.

### Evidence to Provide for AG Closure

1. GitHub Actions accessibility run URL (passing)
2. Screenshots in `/evidence/` for Context Sage route
3. Live staging URL (GitHub Pages)
4. AMORTIZATION.md section with falsifiable claims

### Request for IA Review

Please review this proposal and confirm:

1. **Understanding Gate:** Do you understand the technical approach and artifact characteristics?

2. **Concerns:** Are there architectural, accessibility, or epistemic concerns with this integration?

3. **Evidence requirements:** What additional evidence would you need beyond the standard protocol?

## Turn 2: IA Response

*[Awaiting ChatGPT response]*

## Protocol Notes for IA

When responding, please:
1. Explicitly state whether Understanding Gate can close
2. Raise any concerns about the approach
3. Specify evidence requirements for Agreement Gate
4. Note any concerns about Tufte styling / contrast

Remember: You cannot render SPAs. Screenshots and GitHub Actions URLs are your primary evidence sources. This is the second artifact in the sequence - the infrastructure is proven.

## IA Review — Context Sage Website Integration  
**Role:** Inspecting AI (IA)  
**Protocol:** Skill Forge (Heterogeneous AI Deliberation)  
**Cycle:** Second artifact (post-v1.1.0)

---

## Understanding Gate (UG)

**UG can close.**

I understand the proposal end-to-end:

- Existing **pure React** artifact (`ContextSageWebsite.jsx`) is copied from `vite-playground` into `portfolio/src/artifacts/`.
- Artifact is wrapped in a **page component** with established **boundary, provenance, authorship markers**, then mounted inside the existing **DemoContainer** for containment.
- A **HashRouter route** is added at `/#/context-sage`.
- Landing page artifact list is updated from deferred → active.
- **axe-core multi-route accessibility tests** are extended to include the new path.

This is consistent with v1.1.0 infrastructure and the **single-artifact-per-cycle** invariant.

---

## Concerns / Red Flags

### 1. Style Isolation (Primary Technical Risk)
“DemoContainer provides style isolation” is only true if isolation is real.

React CSS is global unless:
- styles are inline-only, or
- CSS Modules / scoped CSS-in-JS are used, or
- Shadow DOM / iframe boundary exists.

**Actionable requirement:**  
Verify `ContextSageWebsite` does **not** define or import global selectors (`body`, `html`, `a`, `p`, etc.).  
All styling must be wrapper-scoped (e.g., `.contextSageRoot …`) or inline.

This is the first thing I will inspect in the diff.

---

### 2. Keyboard + Semantic Navigation
You reference “tab-based section switching.”

If tabs exist, they must be real tabs:
- `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `role="tabpanel"`
- Correct `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, `id` wiring
- Arrow-key navigation (left/right)
- Predictable focus management

If navigation is anchor-based instead, ensure:
- Heading hierarchy is correct
- Focus order is logical
- Skip navigation is not broken

This is the most likely source of accessibility regressions.

---

### 3. Color Contrast (Measured, Not Assumed)
Cream background + dark text is often safe, but failures usually occur in:
- links
- code blocks
- marginalia / sidenotes
- light gray text

**Requirement:** axe-core pass + at least one explicit contrast verification for:
- body text
- link color
- code text

---

### 4. Epistemic / Provenance Hygiene
Current mitigations are good:
- `ProvenanceHeader`
- `EpistemicBadge status="ILLUSTRATIVE"`
- `AuthorshipMarker type="AI"`

Remaining risk: artifact content may **sound operational** (documentation-like claims) rather than illustrative.

**Requirement:**  
The artifact text itself must clearly distinguish:
- what exists in-repo now
- what is conceptual / illustrative
- what is proposed

If this distinction already exists in the artifact, no change required.  
If not, add a minimal, non-redundant disclaimer **inside the demo boundary** only.

---

## Evidence Required for Agreement Gate (AG)

Beyond the standard protocol, the following evidence is required:

1. **GitHub Actions run URL**
   - Accessibility workflow passing
   - Must clearly include the `/#/context-sage` route

2. **Screenshots committed to `/evidence/`**
   - `context-sage_above-the-fold.png`  
     (boundary markers + provenance visible)
   - `context-sage_mid-page.png`  
     (typography, margins, sidenotes)
   - `context-sage_nav-interaction.png`  
     (selected tab / section state, if applicable)
   - Optional but strong:  
     `context-sage_keyboard-focus.png`  
     (visible focus ring in navigation and body)

3. **Style Isolation Evidence**
   One of the following:
   - Screenshot evidence showing other artifact routes unchanged after integration, **or**
   - Code-level proof that all ContextSage styles are wrapper-scoped and no global selectors are introduced

4. **AMORTIZATION.md Entry**
   Must include:
   - Actual time vs expected
   - Explicit reuse claims from v1.1.0
   - At least one falsifiable statement, e.g.:
     - “0 new dependencies”
     - “1 new route”
     - “1 new axe route entry”
     - “0 global CSS selectors added”

## Constraint Reminder

Do **not** introduce new abstractions or infrastructure “cleanups” during this cycle.

Goal: **repeatability and auditability**, not elegance.

---

## Protocol Update Request (HO Action)

This review reveals a missing constraint in the initializing exchange:

**Add to the initializing exchange protocol:**
> IA reviews are delivered in **Markdown** suitable for direct pasting into cross-agent deliberation logs. Plaintext responses are non-compliant.

This should be enforced at protocol initialization to avoid reformatting friction and preserve evidentiary traceability.
