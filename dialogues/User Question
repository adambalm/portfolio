so, for starters:

“code gets executed”

what code/language?
this is to build an LLM, or to build something which is integrated into an LLM, or am I off-base with the line of questioning?

“each turn saved to memory bank”

where/whose is that memory bank (literal location, or general if cloud-based), and how is it saved?    

“claude….can operate all machines on the network”

meaning which machines? Servers at dan’s? your local laptop? both?

“playwright”

something you added to claude, or gave it access to, or have on one of the machines you mentioned?
maybe not right away, but I would like to learn more about that, especially an understanding of “takes screenshots that vision models then analyzes”

“Gemini” 
“…claude asks….to use a specific prompt for Gemini”

(same goes as above for Playwright)
