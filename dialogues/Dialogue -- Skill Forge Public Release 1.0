# ⚔️ Protocol Initiation: Skill Forge V2 (Governance Artifact)

**Role:** You are the **Artifact Builder**.
**Protocol:** `SKILL-FORGE-V2.2.0-GOVERNANCE`

## 1. Context Loading (The Skill Forge Pattern)
Before proceeding, you must load the following epistemic assets from the repository to ground your execution:

1.  **The Process (Skill):** Read `workspace/skills/artifact-builder.md`.
    * *Constraint:* You must adhere to the boundary markers, WCAG compliance standards, and file structure defined here.
2.  **The Integration (Skill):** Read `workspace/skills/artifact-integration.md`.
    * *Constraint:* Follow the established routing and navigation patterns in `App.jsx`.
3.  **The Existing Visuals (Artifact):** Read `src/artifacts/SkillForgeVisualizer.jsx`.
    * *Constraint:* Understand the current state, but do not overwrite it. We are forking to V2.

## 2. The Interaction Rules (Engine vs. Brake)
We are building a new artifact, `SkillForgeVisualizerV2.jsx`, which visualizes the "Engine vs. Brake" philosophy.

**The "Reword Gate" Rule:**
You must implement a **Cognitive Brake** component.
* **State:** The "Approve" action is **LOCKED** by default.
* **Unlock Condition:** The user must type a rationalization (>50 chars) into a text area.
* **Epigraph:** You must display this quote above the input:
    > *"Bring me to the test, and I the matter will reword, which madness would gambol from." — Hamlet (III.iv)*

**The "Swimlane" Rule:**
You must refactor the layout into a **Cybernetic Loop**:
* **Desktop:** 3-Column Grid (`Human Orchestrator` → `Model A` → `Model B`).
* **Mobile:** Vertical Stack.

**The "Economics" Rule:**
You must replace the static text with a **Dynamic SVG Sparkline**.
* **Inputs:** Keep the 4 existing sliders.
* **Logic:** Use the provided `calculateChartPath` function (see below) to ensure the math is accurate.

## 3. Execution Plan Request
**Do not write code yet.**
First, explain the **Interaction Rules** back to me as you understand them.
1.  How will you implement the "Reword Gate" using our existing component patterns?
2.  How will you ensure the SVG chart is responsive on mobile?
3.  Confirm you have located the `artifact-builder` skill and are ready to proceed.

### Appendix: Chart Logic (Immutable)
```javascript
const calculateChartPath = (width, height, D, S, P, N) => {
  const maxN = 20;
  const manualCostFunc = (n) => n * 100;
  const forgeCostFunc = (n) => D + (n - 1) * (S + P * 100);

  const maxCost = Math.max(manualCostFunc(maxN), forgeCostFunc(maxN));
  const getX = (n) => (n / maxN) * width;
  const getY = (cost) => height - (cost / maxCost) * height;

  const manualPath = `M ${getX(0)} ${getY(0)} L ${getX(maxN)} ${getY(manualCostFunc(maxN))}`;
  const forgePath = `M ${getX(0)} ${getY(D)} L ${getX(maxN)} ${getY(forgeCostFunc(maxN))}`;

  return { manualPath, forgePath };
};
