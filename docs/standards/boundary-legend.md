# Boundary Legend

> **Canary:** `SYSTEM-SPEC-BUNDLE-2026-01-07-V1`
> **Status:** VERIFIED
> **Applies to:** All governed artifacts on the portfolio

---

## Purpose

This document explains the boundary marker system used on the governed surface. It is intended for **non-expert readers** encountering artifacts for the first time.

The boundary system prevents **epistemic authority laundering** — the process by which AI-generated content acquires unearned credibility by appearing alongside human-authored content without clear differentiation.

---

## The Four Boundary Markers

### 1. Provenance Header

**What it shows:** Where the artifact came from.

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Generated by** | The agent (human or AI) that produced this artifact |
| **Date** | When the artifact was generated |
| **Context** | The deliberation or project context |
| **Source** | Link to the source material or dialogue |

**What it claims:**
- This artifact has a traceable origin
- The generating agent is identified

**What it does NOT claim:**
- The content is correct
- The content has been verified
- The generating agent is authoritative

---

### 2. Epistemic Badge

**What it shows:** How verified the claims in this artifact are.

| Status | Meaning | Visual |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **VERIFIED** | Claims have been checked against sources | Green |
| **ILLUSTRATIVE** | Shows capability; not making truth claims | Blue |
| **EXPLORATORY** | Work in progress; may contain errors | Gold |

**What it claims:**
- The artifact has been categorized by inspection status
- The reader should calibrate trust accordingly

**What it does NOT claim:**
- VERIFIED means "absolutely true"
- ILLUSTRATIVE means "unimportant"
- EXPLORATORY means "ignore this"

**Calibration guidance:**
- **VERIFIED**: You may cite this with appropriate attribution
- **ILLUSTRATIVE**: Treat as demonstration, not reference material
- **EXPLORATORY**: Engage critically; errors are expected

---

### 3. Authorship Marker

**What it shows:** Who made this artifact.

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Human-authored** | A human wrote this content |
| **AI-generated** | An AI agent produced this content |
| **Human-AI collaborative** | Both human and AI contributed substantively |

**What it claims:**
- The authorship category is disclosed
- The reader can factor authorship into their evaluation

**What it does NOT claim:**
- AI-generated content is inferior
- Human-authored content is superior
- Collaborative content is "the best of both"

---

### 4. Demo Container

**What it shows:** Visual containment of demo content.

**Visual indicators:**
- Dashed border (2px)
- "Demo Content" label at top-left corner
- White background with padding

**What it claims:**
- This content is contained and bounded
- It is distinct from the surrounding page infrastructure

**What it does NOT claim:**
- Content inside is less important
- Content outside is more authoritative

---

## Decision History Disclosure

Beyond static markers, the boundary system supports **decision history disclosure** — mechanisms for showing how decisions within an artifact were reached.

### High-Deliberation Elements

Elements that required significant deliberation during artifact production should be marked with a **deliberation indicator**. This allows readers to:
- Identify which parts of an artifact were contested or complex
- Access the reasoning behind specific decisions
- Understand where uncertainty remains

**Deliberation levels:**

| Level | Indicator | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Standard** | None | Routine decision; no special deliberation required |
| **Elevated** | `[deliberated]` | Required explicit discussion between agents |
| **Contested** | `[contested]` | Agents disagreed; HO intervention resolved |

### Tooltip Disclosure Pattern

For UI implementations, high-deliberation elements SHOULD support tooltip or expandable disclosure:

```
[Element with elevated deliberation]
  └─ Tooltip: "This decision was deliberated in Turn 5.
              GA proposed X, IA flagged concern Y,
              HO resolved with Z."
```

**Implementation note:** This standard defines the *semantic requirements* for decision history disclosure. The UI implementation (tooltips, expandable panels, etc.) is deferred to a subsequent cycle.

---

## Dialogue Audit Access

Artifacts produced through Skill Forge cycles have an associated **dialogue record**. This record is the authoritative source for understanding how the artifact was produced.

### Audit Summary Pattern

Each governed artifact SHOULD provide access to a simplified audit summary:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Dialogue** | Link to the full dialogue file |
| **Turns** | Number of deliberation turns |
| **Gates passed** | UG, AG, Step 9 status |
| **Key decisions** | Bulleted list of major decision points |

### Attribution Paraphrase

For elements with elevated deliberation, the audit summary SHOULD include an **attribution paraphrase** — a simplified statement of who proposed what and how it was resolved:

> **Example:**
> "Footer standardization was proposed by GA (Turn 1), contested by IA on scope grounds (Turn 2), and resolved by HO decision DP-2(B) mandating blocking until standardized."

This allows readers to understand the deliberation without reading the full dialogue.

---

## Semantic Distinctions

The four markers address **orthogonal dimensions**:

| Dimension | Question Answered | Marker |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **Origin** | Where did this come from? | Provenance Header |
| **Verification** | How checked are the claims? | Epistemic Badge |
| **Attribution** | Who made this? | Authorship Marker |
| **Containment** | Is this bounded from infrastructure? | Demo Container |

These are **not synonyms**. An artifact can be:
- AI-generated (authorship) AND verified (epistemic status)
- Human-authored (authorship) AND exploratory (epistemic status)
- Collaborative (authorship) AND illustrative (epistemic status)

Do not conflate these dimensions.

## What the Boundary System Does NOT Do

The boundary system is **not**:

1. **A trust score** — It does not rate artifacts on a scale
2. **A quality metric** — It does not measure how "good" content is
3. **A recommendation system** — It does not tell you what to read
4. **A filter** — It does not hide or de-prioritize content
5. **A guarantee** — Markers can be wrong; they are claims, not proofs

The boundary system **is**:

1. **A disclosure mechanism** — It reveals what would otherwise be hidden
2. **A calibration tool** — It helps readers adjust their expectations
3. **An audit trail** — It enables tracing content to its source
4. **A containment system** — It prevents unmarked content from gaining false authority

---

## Reader Responsibilities

The boundary system supports but does not replace reader judgment. Readers should:

1. **Check the provenance** — Know where content comes from
2. **Note the epistemic status** — Adjust expectations accordingly
3. **Consider authorship** — Factor it into your evaluation
4. **Recognize containment** — Understand what is demo vs infrastructure
5. **Access decision history** — When uncertain, consult the deliberation record
6. **Exercise judgment** — Markers inform; they do not decide for you

---

## Implementation Notes

This document defines **semantic requirements**. Implementation details are addressed in separate cycles:

| Requirement | Implementation Status |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Static markers (Provenance, Badge, Authorship, Container) | Implemented in `src/components/` |
| Collapsible legend on landing page | Deferred to implementation cycle |
| Tooltip disclosure for high-deliberation elements | Deferred to implementation cycle |
| Dialogue audit link in artifacts | Deferred to implementation cycle |
| Attribution paraphrase generation | Deferred to implementation cycle |
