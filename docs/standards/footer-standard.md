# Footer Standard

> **Canary:** `SYSTEM-SPEC-BUNDLE-2026-01-09-V2`
> **Status:** VERIFIED
> **Applies to:** All governed artifacts on the portfolio

---

## Purpose

This standard defines the required, optional, and prohibited content for artifact footers on the governed surface. It eliminates footer divergence and ensures consistent epistemic framing across all artifacts.

---

## Scope

This standard applies to:
- All artifacts in `src/artifacts/`
- All future artifacts integrated via Skill Forge cycles
- The shell footer in `src/components/Layout.jsx`

This standard does NOT apply to:
- Marketing surface content (when separated)
- External documentation
- README files

---

## Required Fields

Every governed artifact footer MUST contain:

| Field | Format | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Canary** | `Canary: [CANARY-STRING]` | `Canary: SKILLFORGE-V2.2.0-2025-01-05` |
| **Version** | `Version X.Y.Z` | `Version 2.2.0` |
| **Accessibility** | `WCAG 2.1 AA` | `WCAG 2.1 AA` |

### Rationale

- **Canary**: Enables artifact integrity verification and provenance tracing
- **Version**: Enables change tracking and regression identification
- **Accessibility**: Affirms compliance commitment (hard-blocked by CI)

---

## Optional Fields

Governed artifact footers MAY contain:

| Field | Format | Guidance |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Copyright** | `© [Year] [Name]` | Only if human authorship is primary |
| **Citation Style** | `[Style] Edition` | e.g., `APA 7th Edition` — only if artifact contains citations |
| **Language Indicator** | `[Languages]` | e.g., `EN, ES, ZH` — only if multilingual |
| **Generator** | `Generated by [Agent]` | Redundant with Provenance Header; include only if footer is the sole marker |
| **Attribution Contact** | `[Name] · [Platform]` | Author contact for attribution purposes; links must indicate destination |

### Guidance on Optional Fields

- **Do not include optional fields by default.** Add them only when they provide information not available elsewhere in the boundary markers.
- **Avoid redundancy.** If the Provenance Header shows the generator, don't repeat it in the footer.

## Prohibited Content

Governed artifact footers MUST NOT contain:

| Prohibited | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| **Marketing language** | e.g., "Best in class", "Industry leading" — violates epistemic containment |
| **Unverifiable claims** | e.g., "100% accurate" — cannot be substantiated |
| **External links without context** | Links must indicate destination and purpose |
| **Decorative content** | Footers are functional, not aesthetic |
| **Marketing social icons** | Engagement-seeking elements (e.g., "Follow us!") not appropriate for governed surface |

### Clarification: Attribution vs. Marketing

**Attribution contact** (permitted) provides a way to reach the author for questions about the work. It serves an epistemic purpose: accountability and follow-up.

**Marketing social icons** (prohibited) seek engagement, followers, or promotion. They serve a commercial purpose that contaminates epistemic space.

The distinction is intent: attribution enables accountability; marketing seeks engagement.

## Footer Schema

### Minimum Compliant Footer

```
Canary: [CANARY-STRING] | Version X.Y.Z | WCAG 2.1 AA
```

### Full Footer (All Optional Fields)

```
Canary: [CANARY-STRING] | Version X.Y.Z | WCAG 2.1 AA
© [Year] [Name] | [Citation Style] | [Languages]
```

---

## Visual Styling Requirements

| Property | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Border** | `border-top: 1px solid` with muted color (e.g., `#ccc`, `#e2e8f0`) |
| **Padding** | Minimum `16px` vertical padding |
| **Font size** | `12px` to `14px` — subordinate to content |
| **Text color** | Must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast (4.5:1 against background) |
| **Alignment** | Centered preferred; left-aligned acceptable |

---

## Migration Guide

### Current State (Pre-Standard)

| Artifact | Current Footer | Compliance |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| SkillForgeVisualizer | Version + WCAG + Citation | Missing canary |
| ContextSageDemo | Copyright only | Missing canary, version, WCAG |
| MementoDemo | Copyright only | Missing canary, version, WCAG |

### Required Changes

1. **SkillForgeVisualizer** (`src/artifacts/SkillForgeVisualizer.jsx:1169-1173`)
   - Add: `Canary: SKILLFORGE-V2.2.0-2025-01-05`
   - Retain: Version, WCAG, Citation

2. **ContextSageDemo** (`src/artifacts/ContextSageDemo.jsx:686-689`)
   - Add: `Canary: [TO BE ASSIGNED]`
   - Add: `Version X.Y.Z`
   - Add: `WCAG 2.1 AA`
   - Retain: Copyright (optional)

3. **MementoDemo** (`src/artifacts/MementoDemo.jsx:426-429`)
   - Add: `Canary: MEMENTO-DEMO-2026-01-05-VITE-READY`
   - Add: `Version 1.0.0`
   - Add: `WCAG 2.1 AA`
   - Retain: Copyright (optional)

### Migration Authorization

Footer migration is **implementation work** and requires a separate Skill Forge cycle with Execution Authorization. This standard defines *what* must change; a subsequent cycle will *execute* the changes.

---

## Shell Footer

The shell footer (`src/components/Layout.jsx`) has a different purpose than artifact footers. It provides site-level context, not artifact-level metadata.

### Shell Footer Requirements

The shell footer MUST contain:
- Brief explanation of boundary marker system
- WCAG compliance statement

The shell footer MUST NOT contain:
- Artifact-specific metadata
- Version numbers (shell is infrastructure, not artifact)
- Canaries (shell is not a versioned artifact)

---

## Compliance Verification

Footer compliance will be verified by:
1. **IA inspection** during Skill Forge cycles
2. **Manual review** during Step 9 handshake
3. **Future automation** (optional): CI check for required fields
