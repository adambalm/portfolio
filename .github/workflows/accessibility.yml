# Accessibility CI - Hard block on WCAG violations
#
# This workflow enforces accessibility as a structural constraint,
# not a late-stage checklist. Integration is blocked if:
# - Any axe-core violation with impact "critical" or "serious"
# - Missing language toggle functionality
# - Contrast failures
# - Missing alt text
#
# Evidence artifact for Skill Forge deliberation.
